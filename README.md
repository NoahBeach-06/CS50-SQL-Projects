# CS50 SQL - Harvard University

This repository contains my solutions to **CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL**. 

As a Physics student at Carleton University, I am completing this course to build a 
stronger foundation in data management and relational logic to supplement my 
computational physics work.

## Week 0
**Focus:** Querying
* Practiced retrieving data from a SQLite database using `SELECT`.
* Applied filtering logic using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, and Boolean operators.
* Used aggregate functions like `COUNT` and `AVG` to summarize dataset properties.

## Week 1
**Focus:** Relating
* Covered one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relations, and modelled them using Entity Relationship Diagrams.
* Practiced more advanced queries using concepts such as subqueries and `IN`.
* Used `JOIN` operations (including `LEFT JOIN` and `NATURAL JOIN`) to query and interpret relational data.
* Applied **set operations** (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`) and **grouping logic** (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) to synthesize and filter multi-dimensional datasets.
