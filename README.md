# CS50 SQL - Harvard University

This repository contains my solutions for **CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL**. 

As a Physics student at Carleton University, I am completing this course to build a 
stronger foundation in data management and relational logic to supplement my 
computational physics work.

## Week 0: Cyberchase
**Focus:** Basic Querying
* Practiced retrieving data from a SQLite database using `SELECT`.
* Applied filtering logic using `WHERE`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and Boolean operators.
* Used aggregate functions like `COUNT` and `AVG` to summarize dataset properties.
